# SPAM-CALSSIFIER-USING-SVM
This project consist of the code and a report on Spam classifier using Support vector Machine. Regularization parameter has been used and the best has been found out from a range of values.
Numpy pandas and Sklearn library
The dataset originally contains two files with data and headings separately
They were merged using excel as it is fast and efficient, given the size of the data, and named spam_complete.csv
Information on the dataset:Number of Instances: 4601 (1813 Spam = 39.4%), Number of Attributes: 58 (57 continuous, 1 nominal class label)
The objective described, there is more emphasis on the False Positive and misclassifications, hence precision and misclassification has been optimised in the given code 
The Support vector Machine algorithm is used to classify the emails
Regularisation parameter has been used and the best value is found out by running a loop for different values.
